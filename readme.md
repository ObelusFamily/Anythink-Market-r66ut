## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## Steps for setting up local envirnoment:

1. first install docker.
2. After installation you can verify using the following commands on your terminal: docker -v , docker -compose -v .
3. if it is working correctly , let's check from your browser using http://localhost:3000/api/ping .
4. now lets check the frontend and see that is is connected with backend.
5. if it is working properly then create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register .

6. And you are all set.ðŸ˜Š
